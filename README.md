- Use constraint propagation and search to build an agent that reasons like a human would to efficiently solve any Sudoku puzzle

## [forward planning agent](/2_Classical%20Planning)

- Build agents that can reason to achieve their goals using search and symbolic logicâ€”like the NASA Mars rovers

## [game playing agent](/3_Adversarial%20Search)

- Extend classical search to adversarial domains, to build agents that make good decisions without any human intervention such as the DeepMind AlphaGo agent

## [part of speech tagger](/4_HMM%20Tagger)

- Model real-world uncertainty through probability to perform pattern recognition
