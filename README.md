#### Welcome! These are the projects I've completed for Udacity's [Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898)

## [sudoku solver](/1_Sudoku)
- use constraint propagation and search to build an agent that reasons like a human would to efficiently solve any Sudoku puzzle

## [forward planning agent](/2_Classical%20Planning)
- build agents that can reason to achieve their goals using search and symbolic logic—like the NASA mars rovers

## [game playing agent](/3_Adversarial%20Search)

- extend classical search to adversarial domains, to build agents that make good decisions without any human intervention such as the deepmind alphaGo agent

## [part of speech tagger](/4_HMM%20Tagger)

- model real-world uncertainty through probability to perform pattern recognition
