projects for [udacity's artificial intelligence nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-artificial-intelligence-nanodegree--nd898)

## [sudoku solver](/1_Sudoku)
- Use constraint propagation and search to build an agent that reasons like a human would to efficiently solve any Sudoku puzzle

## [forward planning agent](/2_Classical_Planning)

- Build agents that can reason to achieve their goals using search and symbolic logicâ€”like the NASA Mars rovers

## [game playing agent](/3_Adversarial_Search)

- Extend classical search to adversarial domains, to build agents that make good decisions without any human intervention such as the DeepMind AlphaGo agent

## [part of speech tagger](/4_HMM_Tagger)

- Model real-world uncertainty through probability to perform pattern recognition
